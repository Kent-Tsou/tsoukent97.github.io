        <h1>What is the difference between HTML and CSS?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>HTML and CSS are essentially different front end tools to make a website look the way it is. They work together to make a website and are inseparable. HTML is techically the structure of the webiste, containing the title, paragraphs and links to the CSS file. CSS allows the website to look nice and neat by adding in colours, fonts, sizes, padding, margin and styles. The best way to describe is by looking at a house. HTML is the foundation of the house, including metal, wood, windows, doors and tiles. CSS is then the design of the door, the color of the tiles and then size of the windows.</p>

        <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
        <br>
        <p>In web development and computer programming, control flow or flow of control is essetially the order function cells, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running. Many programming languages have what are called control flow statements, which determine what section of code is run in a program at any time. For example, an if/else statement. It is important that the layout and structure of your code is considered, so that your computer is able to give the information in the way you want it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Loops are a programming element that repeat a portion of code a set number of times until the desired process is complete, which allows you to be efficient and save time. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things. Many examples include for loops and while loops. The for loop statement defines the start and end point as well as the increment for each iteration, while the while loop only keeps looping if a condition is valid. However, for loops are preferred by most people as it is easier to read and cleaner.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>What Is The DOM?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is a programming platform that appears on your web browser when the "inspect" button is activated. It ultimately allows manipulation of HTML, CSS, JS and all sorts of things. Another cool way to use the DOM is debugging, it allows you to see what is going on and what should be fixed by changing values and codes. No matter how much of the webiste is changed during this time, nothing will actually be changed to it once it is refreshed. </p>

        <h1>The Difference Between Accessing Data From Arrays and Objects</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Objects represent “things” with characteristics, while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. Both dot and bracket notation allow us to access, add, change, and remove items from an object, while zero-based indexing and a variety of built-in methods let us access and alter items in an array.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ojbects can be anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value</p>
        <br>
        <p>Arrays first item is always the 0th item, this is called zero-based indexing. There are four ways that are known to alter the items in the arrays, these include the four below:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <ul>1. .push() - This adds an item to the end of the array.</ul>
            <ul>2. .pop() - This Removes the last item of the array.</ul>
            <ul>3. .unshift() - This adds an item at the beginning of the array.</ul>
            <ul>4. .shift() - This Removes the first item of the array.</ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h1>What Are Functions And Why They Are Useful</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. In general, if there's an input theres an output. A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked. If the function is invoked, it means that the users pressed a button, called from a JavaScript code or self invoked. Once the function receives a return statement, then the function stops executing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Benefits of functions include:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <ul>1. Avoid repetition of codes.</ul>
            <ul>2. Increases program readability.</ul>
            <ul>3. Divide a complex problem into simpler ones.</ul>
            <ul>4. Reduces chances of error.</ul>
            <ul>5. Modifying a program becomes easier by using functions.</ul>
        </ol>
