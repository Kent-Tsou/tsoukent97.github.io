        <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My long term goal is to have a steady job that I enjoy to do. Any job with growth potential and improvement would interest me greatly. However, in this moment of time I would love to find a job in web development in Auckland. </p>
        <br>
        <h1>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My strengths includes great time management, passionate learner, and great problem solving skills. These qualities allow me to learn most things without a problem. However, I have a few flaws when it comes to learning, as I have a short attention span which lasts about only 30-40 minutes. During that time I can work at optimal efficiency and productivity, but after that I need breaks in between to be able to work with that productivity again.  </p>
        <br>
        <h1>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I would like to develop my team-communication skills. This is because sometimes I dont communicate everything to everyone on the team clearly beccause I dont think it is necessary. However, this results in lack of communication and miscommuncation too. Another thing I want to improve on is my courage to perform in fornt of my peers and not be afraid to be judged.  </p>
        <br>
        <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I will manage my workload appropriately by creating a schedule and timetable and combine it with toggel (time tracking app) to track if I am working through the day according to my plan. That way, things wont pile up and progress is still made each and every day. I will be able to work my other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives well by communicating with them constantly. I believe there is no such thing as over-communication and as long as I am willing to do this there should'nt be a problem. However, lack of communication is my problem at the moment and I hope to improve it.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
        <br>
        <p>As writen above, I am showing lack of commnuication at the moment. However, I am determined to ask questions constantly and post on the foundation slack channel when I am supposed to and not be scared.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I only expected one thing out of the team, and that was to answer my questions when they are asked. It it safe to say that they have lived up to my expectations with speedy replies and great answers.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I believe I do need to start my day at 10 instead of 9 to avoid taking power naps during the day. This is because power naps often turn into an hour long naps.</p>
