        This is my sprint 4 technical blog, here I will share my experience with Javascript and my learning process. 
        I have encountered many problems while attempting to solve Javascript Kata exercises. However, I have learnt alot from just encountering problems and attempting to solve them. 
        This includes doing research and figuring out what each operator, operand, built-in array methods and loops means.
        A few key memorable problems that I have faced include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <ol></ol>
        </ul>
        Solved a problem in an elegant way.
        In both cases:

        What was the problem?
        What problem solving techniques did you use?
        How did you feel throughout the process?
        What did you learn?
        Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:

        Pseudocode
        Trying something
        Rubber ducky method
        Reading error messages
        Console.logging
        Googling
        Asking your peers for help
        Asking coaches for help
        Improving your process with reflection
