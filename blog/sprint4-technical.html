        This is my sprint 4 technical blog, here I will share my experience with Javascript and my learning process. 
        I have encountered many problems while attempting to solve Javascript Kata exercises. However, I have learnt alot from just encountering problems and attempting to solve them. 
        This includes doing research and figuring out what each operator, operand, built-in array methods and loops mean.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>A few key memorable problems that I have faced include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <ol>Solved a problem in an elegant way</ol>
            <ol>What problem solving techniques did you use?</ol>
            <ol>How did you feel throughout the process?</ol>
            <ol>What did you learn?</ol>
            <ol>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</ol>
        </ul>
