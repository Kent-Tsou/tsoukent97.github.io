        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence is otherwise known as EQ or emotional quotient.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence breaks down to 4 key components:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Self-awareness</li>
            <li>2. Self-management</li>
            <li>3. Social-awareness</li>
            <li>4. Relationship management</li>
          </ol> 
        <br>
        <p>Good ways to improve emotional intelligence include:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Learn what triggers are and how they can impact your emotions.</li>
            <li>2. Ask for constructive feedback from others to enable growth in knowledge and competence.</li>
            <li>3. Actively listen to others, stepping back in order to observe in an objective manner.</li>
            <li>4. Practice deep breathing and other relaxing exercises to keep a clear mind.</li>
            <li>5. Constantly acknowledging others’ needs and feelings with no judgement.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>IQ and EQ are often mistaken by people but the concepts are fairly straight forward. Merriam-Webster defines IQ as “a number used to express the apparent relative intelligence of a person. Determined by either the ratio of the mental age (as reported on a standardized test) to the chronological age multiplied by 100 - or a score determined by one's performance on a standardized intelligence test relative to the average performance of others of the same age.” On the other hand, EQ is the ability to identify and manage your emotions and the emotions of others.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is often linked to ones mental well-being as well as it's mental state. Emtional intelligence can provide a fullfilling and happy life by inserting a framework which brings standards of intelligence to emotional responses and understand that these responeses link to what humans do everyday and how they feel. This also relates accordingly to the workforce too. Being able to understand what other collegues are thinking and feeling, then being able to to respond to that emotion accordingly is huge challenge. However, having a good EQ at work is a great tool and skillset that allows you to work cohesively within teams, deal with change more effectively, and manage stress – thus enabling them to more efficiently pursue business objectives. This immediately shows how the four key factors of emotional intelligence are so important and so significant.  </p>
