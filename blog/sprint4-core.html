        <h1>Principles of Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Neuroplasticity can be split into two parts, neuro and plasticity. Neural means that it's related to the nervous system, while plasticity means that there is room for change and adaptivity. Human brains can encode experiences and learn new behaviours. On the other hand, it is also a mechanism when the damaged brain learns lost behavior in response to rehabilitation. The brain forms new neurons and lay down connections with the neurons, in response to learning and repeated behaviours. Neuroplasticity is very experience-dependant, in which some prioritise over others.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Factors that influence the facilitation of neuroplasticity include the following:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Use it or lose it - failure to practice what you learn can lead to loss of abilities.</li>
            <li>2. Use it and improve it - applying training to what you have learnt can improve abilities.</li>
            <li>3. Specifiy - the nature of training experience changes the development of the brain</li>
            <li>4. Repetition matters - change can happen significantly if done sufficient enough of times.</li>
            <li>5. Intensity matters - change requires intense training.</li>
            <li>6. Time matters - different forms of change happen at different times during training.</li>
            <li>7. Salience matters - the training must be meaningful in order to form change.</li>
            <li>8. Age matters - training-induced change occurs more readily in younger brains.</li>
            <li>9. Transference - Change in function as a result of one training experience can even lead to learning other similar skills.</li>
            <li>10. Interference - Brain changes that result in bad habits can interfere with learning good habits.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h1>Benefits of Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes. The more you practice what you love to do, the better you're going to become at it. Physical activity is one of the factors associated with positive neuroplasticity and is the primary focus of the training relationship. Study says that with conistent physical leisure neuroplasticity is optimized and people accelerate in their fields faster with consistent exercise.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>How Neuroplasticity benefits me?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Neuroplasticity benefits me in the most simple and easiest way, which is practicing how to use the languages that I have learnt during this bootcamp. Even if I read the resources 10 times, without physically practicing them I will never know it on that certain level. Practice makes perfect/permanent. </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Studies have shown that people who ha vethe belief that they are in control of their own ability, and can learn and improve those abilities. As cheesy as it sounds, having underlying belief that you are in control of your own destiny is the key to success. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A few ways to develop a growth mindset include:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.</li>
            <li>2. View challenges as opportunities.</li>
            <li>3. Try different learning tactics.</li>
            <li>4. Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”</li>
            <li>5. Stop seeking approval.</li>
            <li>6. Value the process over the end result.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h1>Changes in me after reading about growth mindset</h1>
        <br>
        <p>After reading and researching about neuroplasticity, I have realized that I have always been someone who has had a fixed mindset (opposite of a growth mindset). I have always avoided trouble and challenges. I never really pushed myself to acheive a goal that I really wanted. However, now that I have acknowledged and accepted my imperfections, I am even more motivated and excited about web development than I was before.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Changes to my learning plan/journey and strategy</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My main strategy that I have thought of so far is giving myself one to two hrs of extra time a day after bootcamp, and go over the resources that I have learnt in the past. I often find myself forgetting things that I have learnt, whether its from two weeks ago or two months ago. To sum it up, if I dont use it I lose it, and that's my new goal.</p>
