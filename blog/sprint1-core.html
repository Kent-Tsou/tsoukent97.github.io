            Hello everyone, for those of you who don’t know me my name is Kent. Personally, I have a couple of strengths, weaknesses and values that I have. I believe that I can improve so much more on my strengths and build a better mindset so that I can turn my weaknesses into my strengths.

            My strengths include being able to have a good passionate attitude in every situation. Even after failure, I am still able to bring my strong attitude to come back even stronger. Another strength of mine include team communication skills that I have developed throughout my years of playing sports and working. Playing basketball in teams allowed me to thoroughly understand how to communicate with others and in the best way possible. During my time working in retail, I had to supervise staff which allowed me to realize I needed to approach everyone in a different way for them to work at their optimal potential. I have a very bubbly personality, so I definitely bring a lot of fun, excitement and joy to the team especially during times of high tension and miscommunication. Above all else, my independence is what I am proud of the most. This brings back the time when I was assigned as the junior activity’s coordinator of a social club. Unfortunately, due to personal reasons our senior activity’s coordinator had to resign, which left me as the only one left to organize events throughout the year. For this reason, I had to take up all the responsibilities and workload myself. Given that it was unfair on me, I had the option to cancel some events since there wasn’t enough time for me to handle everything myself, but I refused. Fortunately, with the help of the Vice President of the club we were able to run all the events throughout the year with very high efficiency too.

            My weaknesses include my huge ego, easily satisfied mentality and indecisiveness. I am almost 100% sure this is what my pairs, colleagues and family think of me too. I am not sure how to change my boosted ego besides from telling myself to stay humble. Out of the three weaknesses I have, my easily satisfied mentality is what I want to change the most. Being able to have the mindset of learning more or making something better than it is can benefit me so much. I believe asking myself each and every day if I have done enough can help that and letting myself know that there’s still much more to improve on. On the other hand, indecisiveness correlates to my confidence level, if I am confident in myself and my decision then I know I can better it.
